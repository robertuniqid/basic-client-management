basic-client-management
=======================

Basic Client Management Software, come with Copy Paste Instalation

This is just a simple application with no security implemented, because it seemed like a back-end application in which security shouldn't be a problem, atleast in my opinion.

There is no login system, but you can easily add one, or just simply force a .htaccess login

You can check it out here : http://easy-development.com/client_management/index.php

Yes, I know it's vulnerable to XSS, but considering it's an internal application, the admin can "do bad stuff" anyway.

This basic client management software is build on a basic framework I've created the same time as this software, the framework isn't something that can be used in large projects, but I guess it suits well for small ones.
